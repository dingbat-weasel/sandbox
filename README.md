## Current Focus

**Goal:** Build strong DS/Algorithms foundations for software engineering interviews and deeper understanding.

**Timeline:** 6-month intensive study focusing on:
- Core data structures and algorithms
- LeetCode pattern recognition and problem-solving
- Interview preparation and whiteboarding skills

**Primary Language:** Python (for speed and interview relevance)

**Learning Approach:**
- Topic-based organization (not source-based)
- Clean, refactored implementations
- Focus on understanding patterns and tradeoffs
- Occasional visualizations and creative applications for motivation

## Progress

See [problems/leetcode/README.md](problems/leetcode/README.md) for detailed LeetCode progress tracking.

## Learning Resources

- **NeetCode Roadmap** - Primary interview prep structure
- **MIT 6.006** - Conceptual foundations (deferred)
- **Skiena's Algorithm Design Manual** - Future deep dive

## Philosophy

This repository balances:
- **Interview pragmatism** - Solving problems efficiently for job readiness
- **Conceptual depth** - Understanding the "why" behind patterns and tradeoffs
- **Creative exploration** - Finding unexpected applications to maintain motivation
