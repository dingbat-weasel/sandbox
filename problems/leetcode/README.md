# LeetCode Progress Tracker

Following the **[NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)** for structured interview preparation.

## Overview

**Curriculum:** NeetCode 150 (pattern-based learning with video explanations)
**Target:** 150-200 problems over 6 months
**Language:** Python
**Focus:** Pattern recognition and interview readiness

**Why NeetCode 150?**
- Organized by problem-solving patterns (not just data structures)
- Video explanations for every problem
- Progressive difficulty within each topic
- Teaches you to recognize interview patterns explicitly

## Weekly Workflow

**For each topic:**
1. **Learn** - Watch NeetCode's topic introduction video
2. **Solve** - Work through problems in order (use video explanations when stuck)
3. **Document** - Write solution with pattern notes and complexity analysis
4. **Reflect** - What's the common pattern? When do you use this technique?
5. **Optional** - Weekend: visualize the concept or find a niche use case
